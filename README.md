# DS LA2 QUESTIONS

I'm 95% sure all my programs work as they're supposed to. 

#### Notes:

- I believe 1 asked us to move all even numbers to the front of the list, so I did just that.

- 1a and 2a, I took liberties with and made as simple as possible.

- Type casting a char into an int gives us its ascii value so I used that for 3.

- 4 is just interweaving two char arrays together.

- 5 is probably best done with a stack which I've emulated.

- 6 is five but with a queue.

- The other 6 I only saw today. I'll do it tomorrow. Maybe.

- 7 isn't very dynamic. It can only do ABC+-.

- 8 is a binary tree problem, not the simplest but not the most complex. 
  - Tried generating a random tree run but it gave me problems so I just gave it a tree.  

- 9 works for +-/*.
